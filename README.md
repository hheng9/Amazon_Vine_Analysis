# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program
### The analysis focuses on US reviews in the automotive category from the Amazon Vine programs. We use Google Colaboratory to import PySpark libraries to extract, transform, and load the dataset. We then create servers, databases, and tables in PGadmin while connecting to AWS RDS instances and S3 buckets to upload CSV files.
